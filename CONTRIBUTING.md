## Developing for dc-demostore-integration

Thanks for your interest! We welcome changes of all sizes, from improving existing integrations to adding entirely new ones.
Please consider these guidelines when filing a pull request:

*  Tab indentation.
*  Features and bug fixes should be covered by test cases.
*  Follow styling from eslint config. The easiest way to do this is by using an eslint highlighting plugin.

Pull Requests will be reviewed by internal Amplience team members. Generally, these are merged after two approvals.

To get started, see [Develop Locally.](./docs/dev/develop-locally.md)
